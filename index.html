      <h3>Personal and Early Life</h3>

      <p> Frederick Law Olmsted was born on <span>April 26, 1822</span> in Hartford, Connecticut. From an early age, Frederick Law was interested in the natural world. He worked for a time as a merchant and then journalist before moving to his family farm on Staten Island, New York. Olmsted's career as a journalist allowed him to travel in Europe where he was impressed by the parks in England. </p>
      <p>In 1858 Olmsted entered and won a contest to design a park in New York with his friend Calver Vaux. This was Olmsted's first attempt at landscape design, and that park is Central Park in New York City.</p>
      <p>In 1895 Olmsted retired from his career as a landscape architect and lived until 1903. Olmsted's sons continued their father's work as the nation's first landscape architecture firm.</p>
